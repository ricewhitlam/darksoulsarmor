\usage{
all.armor.combos <- get.all.armor.combos()
}
\arguments{
\item{regular.level}{A length 1 \code{character} indicating the upgrade level of armor pieces ascended via regular titanite. 
Options are \code{"+0"} thru \code{"+10"}. 
Metrics are exact for \code{"+0"} and \code{"+10"}. 
For the other options, metrics are approximated based on the game's default upgrade patterns.
These approximations should be very accurate but will differ from true values slightly.
Defaults to \code{"+0"}.}

\item{twinkling.level}{A length 1 \code{character} indicating the upgrade level of armor pieces ascended via twinkling titanite. 
Options are \code{"+0"} thru \code{"+5"}. 
Metrics are exact for \code{"+0"} and \code{"+5"}. 
For the other options, metrics are approximated based on the game's default upgrade patterns.
These approximations should be very accurate but will differ from true values slightly.
Defaults to \code{"+0"}.}

A \code{data.table} of all possible armor combinations
}
\description{
Produces a table of every possible armor combination in Dark Souls.
This table is large (>10M rows and 17 columns, nearly 2 GB).
Only call this function if there is enough available RAM to support this.
All relevant metrics are included.
All metrics are aggregated as would be expected with perhaps one exception: 
Durability is aggregated by taking the minimum across all armor pieces.
