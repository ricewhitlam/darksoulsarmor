optimal.armor.combos <- get.optimal.armor.combos(endurance.level = 40, unarmored.weight = 12, fap.ring = TRUE, roll = "Fast")
}
\arguments{
\item{max.table.size}{A length 1 \code{numeric} indicating how large the produced table should be.
Defaults to \code{1000}. Passed values will be clamped between 1 and 100,000,000 and cast to an integer.}

\item{starting.class}{A length 1 \code{character} indicating whether to consider unupgraded or fully upgraded armor.
Defaults to \code{"Warrior"}. The vector of available classes is stored as \code{classes}.}

\item{areas.completed}{A \code{character} vector indicating which areas have been completed.
Defaults to all areas being complete. The vector of available areas is stored as \code{areas}.}

\item{upgrade.types}{A \code{character} vector indicating which upgrade types to consider.
There are three types available: \code{"Regular"} (armor pieces that upgrade with regular titanite), 
\code{"Twinkling"} (armor pieces that upgrade with twinkling titanite), 
and \code{"None"} (armor pieces that cannot be upgraded).
Defaults to all types i.e. \code{c("Regular", "Twinkling", "None")}.}

\item{head.filter}{A \code{character} vector indicating which head armor pieces should be included. 
Defaults to all pieces. A vector of available pieces can be accessed via \code{head.data_00$ARMOR}.
If an empty vector is passed, it is assumed that no head armor will be worn.}

\item{chest.filter}{Same as \code{head.filter} but for chest armor pieces. 
A vector of available pieces can be accessed via \code{chest.data_00$ARMOR}.}

\item{hands.filter}{Same as \code{head.filter} but for hand armor pieces.
A vector of available pieces can be accessed via \code{hands.data_00$ARMOR}.}

\item{legs.filter}{Same as \code{head.filter} but for leg armor pieces.
A vector of available pieces can be accessed via \code{legs.data_00$ARMOR}.}

\item{regular.level}{A length 1 \code{character} indicating the upgrade level of armor pieces ascended via regular titanite. 
Options are \code{"+0"} thru \code{"+10"}. 
Metrics are exact for \code{"+0"} and \code{"+10"}. 
For the other options, metrics are approximated based on the game's default upgrade patterns.
These approximations should be very accurate but will differ from true values slightly.
Defaults to \code{"+0"}.}

\item{twinkling.level}{A length 1 \code{character} indicating the upgrade level of armor pieces ascended via twinkling titanite. 
Options are \code{"+0"} thru \code{"+5"}. 
Metrics are exact for \code{"+0"} and \code{"+5"}. 
For the other options, metrics are approximated based on the game's default upgrade patterns.
These approximations should be very accurate but will differ from true values slightly.
Defaults to \code{"+0"}.}

\item{roll}{A length 1 \code{character} indicating desired roll speed. 
Options are \code{"Fast"} (weight at or below 25\% of max equip load), \code{"Mid"} (weight at or below 50\% of max equip load), \code{"Fat"} (weight at or below 100\% of max equip load), and \code{"None"} (weight above 100\% of max equip load).
Defaults to \code{"Fast"}.}

\item{unarmored.weight}{A length 1 \code{numeric} indicating the unarmored weight of the character i.e. weight of weapons.
Defaults to \code{10}.
Passed values are clamped between 0 and 999 and rounded to the nearest decimal point.}

\item{endurance.level}{A length 1 \code{numeric} indicating the level of the character in the Endurance stat. 
This stat increases maximum equip load. Defaults to \code{10}. 
Passed values are clamped between 0 and 99 and rounded to an integer.}

\item{havel.ring}{A length 1 \code{logical} indicating whether Havels Ring is equipped. 
This ring increases maximum equip load by 50\%. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{fap.ring}{A length 1 \code{logical} indicating whether the Ring of Favor and Protection is equipped. 
This ring increases maximum equip load by 20\%. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{wolf.ring}{A length 1 \code{logical} indicating whether the Wolf Ring is equipped. 
This ring increases Poise by 40. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{minima}{A length 12 \code{numeric} indicating minimum allowable values for the following ordered metrics:
PHYS_DEF, STRIKE_DEF, SLASH_DEF, THRUST_DEF, MAG_DEF, FIRE_DEF, LITNG_DEF, POISE, BLEED_RES, POIS_RES, CURSE_RES, DURABILITY.
Defaults to \code{c(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)}.
Passed values are clamped between 0 and 999.}

\item{weights}{A length 10 \code{numeric} indicating weights for the following ordered metrics:
PHYS_DEF, STRIKE_DEF, SLASH_DEF, THRUST_DEF, MAG_DEF, FIRE_DEF, LITNG_DEF, BLEED_RES, POIS_RES, CURSE_RES.
Defaults to \code{c(0.16,0.16,0.16,0.16,0.08,0.08,0.08,0.04,0.04,0.04)}.
These weights are used in the calculation of a score. This score is then optimized across all possible armor combinations.
Increasing the weight on a metric increases its importance to the final score.
The weights do not need to sum to 1, but should all be nonnegative with positive sum.}

\value{
A \code{list} holding (1) the list of arguments which defined the table and (2) a \code{data.table} of optimal armor combinations
}
\description{
Produces a table of optimized armor combinations in Dark Souls.
All relevant metrics are included, as well as a column of scores on which the data is sorted.
These scores are between \code{0} and \code{1} and indicate how optimal each combination is.
The table can be tailored to satisfy various constraints.
