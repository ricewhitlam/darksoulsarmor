\title{List of metrics for every possible upgrade combination}
\format{
This is a list of length (10+1)*(5+1) = 66. Each entry in this list is itself a list. 
Each of these lists holds a vector of means, a vector of standard deviations, and a correlation matrix for the following ten metrics:
PHYS_DEF, STRIKE_DEF, SLASH_DEF, THRUST_DEF, MAG_DEF, FIRE_DEF, LITNG_DEF, BLEED_RES, POIS_RES, CURSE_RES.
The length of 66 reflects all possible upgrade combinations between regular titanite and twinkling titanite.
